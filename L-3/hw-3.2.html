    <p>One of the most important holidays for young people is St. Valentine's Day.
        On is day people thank each other for love and support, exchange small presents and flowers.
        A Valentine card you receive on this day may tell you that someone is in love with you.
        Some people make a proposition on this day. It is the most romantic holiday of the year.
        When spring comes, another popular holiday is celebrated. It is the Women's Day.
        On this day women receive presents and flowers.
        Their families thank them for their support and for everything they do for them.

    </p>
    <p>As for me my favourite spring holiday is Easter. It is connected with our hopes for the better.
    This is the time to think about our future. Many people go on the day before to church and listen to
    the service. They bring baskets with brightly painted eggs and a special Easter cake.
    They believe that Easter eggs and the Easter cake possess magic power and can protect them.
    In the morning after the end of the service, people return home for breakfast. They prepare holiday
    dishes and lay the table. It is a family holiday. We call or visit our relatives and wish them hope and love.
